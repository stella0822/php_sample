# php_sample
php_sample is part of the project vTigerCRM I participated in when I worked at Sibo. vTigerCRM is an open source business system, and my job was to add some security control to the system. Import the file 1.sql to the mysql database, and overlap the files Authenticate.php and Login.php.
